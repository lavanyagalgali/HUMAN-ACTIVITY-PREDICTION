# HUMAN ACTIVITY PREDICTION
**Company Introduction**

client for this project is a Smartphone Company.

They want to predict the human activity and draw other insights like signs of fatigue in an individual for fitness monitoring.

They want to monitor six basic activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs).

One of the key measurements in this process is prediction of these six activities.

**Problem Statement**

Current Scenario

The company has captured data of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually.

Machine learning can help to study data from sensors which are already present in most smartphones and can be analysed to gain rich insights about the candidates/users.

The current scenario has the following problems :

The company has collected a large amount of sensor data from smartphones but is not able to use it efficiently. This data can be utilized to achieve various goals that can help an individual for better health like activity detection and also monitor signs of fatigue.
